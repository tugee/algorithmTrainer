# Specification

Users are able to solve pre-set programming puzzles, view their solutions and submit posts discussing the problems. 
AlgoTrainer has a rating system (upvotes and downvotes) for both the problems and the posts. 

Problems have to be classified to one category of problems, such as "dynamic programming", "recursion", "BFS". 
If the problem is from an actual interview with a firm, it can be also included in the tags.
Problems can be classified with a difficulty level and can be ordered based on the rating it has (upvotes-downvotes).

Posts can be searched based on tags, their title, content and poster.

Users can create a profile on the website which includes some information on how many problems they have solved and links to the posts that they have submitted.
There are two user types: normal user and admin, with moderation privileges and problem setting powers.
